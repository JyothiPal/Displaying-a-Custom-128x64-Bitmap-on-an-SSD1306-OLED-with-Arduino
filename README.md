# Displaying-a-Custom-128x64-Bitmap-on-an-SSD1306-OLED-with-Arduino
This Arduino project demonstrates how to load and display a custom 128x64 monochrome bitmap image on an SSD1306 OLED screen using Adafruit libraries. The image is stored in PROGMEM and rendered with drawBitmap(), making it great for adding visual elements like logos to embedded devices.
